# V9990 Video card

The V9990 was intended as a successor to the V9958 (or supposedly a stripped down version of the never finished Yamaha V9978), but while the other chips in the range had backwards compatibility with the previous generation, the V9990 has some similar functionality but lacks the backwards compatibility.

Still, the V9990 has impressive specifications for the time, some of the features include:

Game Specifications:

For this type, there are two pattern display modes.
* P1 (Display resolution 256 x 212 2 screens)
* P2 (Display resolution 512 x 212)

*Various highly advanced functions are available such as powerful sprite function and omnidirectional scroll function.*

AV Specifications:

For this type, there are four kinds of bitmap display modes which can be displayed on the NTSC or PAL frequency monitor as follows.
* B1 (Display resolution 256 x 212)
* B2 (Display resolution 384 x 240)
* B3 (Display resolution 512 x 212)
* B4 (Display resolution 768 x 240)

*Capable of doubling the resolution in the vertical direction by using interlace.*
*Display is possible up to 32,768 colors/dot.*
*Built-in color palette (64 colors selected out of 32,768 colors).*
*Omnidirectional smooth scrolling is possible.*

Like the [V9958](/expansion/GfxV9958) card, the V9990 has Composite, S-Video and RGB output. The board has 518K of RAM installed and again uses CXA2075M encoder to provide the video output signals.
